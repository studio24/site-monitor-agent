# Site monitor agent
Agent to send data to Studio 24 site monitoring tool

See https://github.com/studio24/site-monitor

## Requirements:
* PHP 5.5+
* [Guzzle 6](https://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/6.5/)
* Would be good to add tests to run on all versions of PHP we use, possibly [PHPUnit polyfills](https://github.com/Yoast/PHPUnit-Polyfills) or [Codeception](https://codeception.com/install)?
